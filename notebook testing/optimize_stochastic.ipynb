    "In this tutorial, we show how to use PyTorch's `optim` module for optimizing BoTorch MC acquisition functions. This is useful if the acquisition function is stochastic in nature (caused by re-sampling the base samples when using the reparameterization trick, or if the model posterior itself is stochastic).\n",

    "*Note:* A pre-packaged, more user-friendly version of the optimization loop we will develop below is contained in the `gen_candidates_torch` function in the `botorch.gen` module. This tutorial should be quite useful if you would like to implement custom optimizers beyond what is contained in `gen_candidates_torch`.\n",

However, it is important to note that there is a **key difference** here compared to training ML models: When training ML models, one typically computes the gradient of an empirical loss function w.r.t. the model's parameters, while here we take the gradient of the acquisition function w.r.t. to the candidate set.\n",

The result of this is an `N`-dim tensor of acquisition function values, evaluated independently. To compute the gradient of the full input `X` via back-propagation, we can for convenience just compute the gradient of the sum of the losses. \n",
    "2. `torch.optim` does not have good built in support for constraints (general constrained stochastic optimization is hard and still an open research area). Here we do something simple and project the value obtained after taking the gradient step to the feasible set - that is, we perform \"projected stochastic gradient descent\". Since the feasible set here is a hyperrectangle, this can be done by simple clamping. Another approach would be to transform the feasible interval for each dimension to the real line, e.g. by using a sigmoid function, and then optimizing in the unbounded transformed space. "
